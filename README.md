<summary><strong>Click to expand Waveform Analysis Procedure</strong></summary>

### Launch GTKWave

```bash
# Launch GTKWave with VCD file
cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC

```

### Signal Selection Process

#### Step 1: Navigate Hierarchy
- In SST (Signal Search Tree) panel, expand `testbench`
- Expand `uut` (unit under test)
- You should see: `core`, `dac`, `pll` modules

**Screenshot Location:** `docs/images/waveforms/gtkwave-hierarchy.png`

#### Step 2: Add Clock Signal
1. Expand `pll` module
2. Click on `CLK` signal
3. Click "Append" button
4. Verify clock appears in waveform viewer

#### Step 3: Add Reset Signal
1. Click on `uut` module
2. In signals panel, find `reset`
3. Click on `reset` and "Append"

#### Step 4: Add Data Bus
1. Expand `core` module
2. Find `OUT[9:0]` signal (10-bit processor output)
3. Click and "Append"

#### Step 5: Add DAC Output
1. Expand `dac` module
2. Find `OUT` signal with type **`real`**
3. Click and "Append"
4. **Important:** Right-click on `uut.dac.OUT` in signals panel
5. Select "Data Format" → "Analog" → "Step"

**Critical Note:** There are two `OUT` signals:
- `uut.core.OUT[9:0]` - Digital bus from processor
- `uut.dac.OUT` - Analog output from DAC (**choose this for analog view**)

**Screenshot Location:** `docs/images/waveforms/signal-selection-process.png`

### Waveform Analysis

#### Key Signals to Analyze:

| Signal | Purpose | Expected Behavior |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `CLK` | System clock from PLL | Square wave, ~100MHz |
| `reset` | System reset | High initially, then low |
| `OUT[9:0]` | Digital data bus | Changing values after reset |
| `dac.OUT` | Analog output | Step waveform following digital values |

#### Analysis Checklist:
- [ ] **Clock Verification**: Stable, periodic square wave
- [ ] **Reset Operation**: Proper initialization sequence
- [ ] **Data Flow**: Digital values changing over time
- [ ] **Analog Conversion**: DAC output tracking digital input

**Screenshot Location:** `docs/images/waveforms/complete-waveform-analysis.png`

### Measurement and Documentation

```bash
# Save GTKWave session
# File → Write Save File → save as "babysoc_analysis.gtkw"

### Common Environment Issues

#### Issue: `sandpiper-saas: command not found`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify Python virtual environment is activated
source sp_env/bin/activate

# Reinstall if necessary
pip install --upgrade sandpiper-saas
```

#### Issue: `iverilog: command not found`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Icarus Verilog
sudo apt install iverilog

# Verify installation
which iverilog
iverilog -V
```

### Compilation Issues

#### Issue: Include file not found
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check file paths
ls -la src/module/
ls -la src/include/

# Verify include directories in iverilog command
iverilog -I src/include -I src/module ...
```

#### Issue: Module not found during compilation
**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure all required modules are present
ls src/module/vsdbabysoc.v
ls src/module/rvmyth.v
ls src/module/avsdpll.v
ls src/module/avsddac.v
```

### Simulation Issues

#### Issue: Simulation hangs or runs indefinitely
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check testbench for proper $finish statement
grep -n "\$finish" src/module/testbench.v

# Verify simulation time limits
grep -n "timescale\|initial" src/module/testbench.v
```

#### Issue: No VCD file generated
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check testbench for VCD dump commands
grep -n "\$dumpfile\|\$dumpvars" src/module/testbench.v

# Verify output directory permissions
ls -la output/pre_synth_sim/
```

### GTKWave Issues

#### Issue: Cannot see analog waveform
**Solution:**
1. Ensure you selected `uut.dac.OUT` (type `real`)
2. Right-click → Data Format → Analog → Step
3. Verify signal is not `uut.OUT` (digital wire)

#### Issue: Waveform appears corrupted
**Solution:**
```bash
# Regenerate VCD file
cd output/pre_synth_sim
./pre_synth_sim.out

# Reload in GTKWave
# File → Reload Waveform
```

### Post-synthesis Issues

#### Issue: ABC assertion failure
**Status:** Known issue, not user error
**Workaround:** Document issue and proceed with pre-synthesis results
**Future Resolution:** Use OpenLANE Docker environment in later weeks
