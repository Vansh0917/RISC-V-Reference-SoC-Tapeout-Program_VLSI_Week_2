### 5.2 Known Issue Documentation

**Error Encountered:**
```
7.22. Executing ABC pass (technology mapping using ABC).
ERROR: Assert `p != NULL' failed in kernel/yosys.cc:453.
Makefile:66: recipe for target 'synth' failed
make: *** [synth] Error 1
```
<img width="1919" height="1079" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-28 232139" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e093b473-5c6a-4c95-90f4-dd09544239d4" />

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Yosys/ABC assertion failure during technology mapping
- Known issue with specific Verilog constructs
- Not related to user error or environment setup

**Impact:**
- Post-synthesis simulation cannot be completed
- Week 2 objectives can still be met with pre-synthesis simulation

**Screenshot Location:** `docs/images/terminal/synthesis-error.png`

### 5.3 Alternative Approaches

#### Option 1: Manual Synthesis Debugging
```bash
# Generate detailed synthesis log
make synth > synthesis.log 2>&1

# Analyze log for specific error location
grep -n "ERROR\|Failed\|Assert" synthesis.log
```

#### Option 2: Use Pre-synthesized Netlist
- Download working netlist from reference implementation
- Place in `output/synth/vsdbabysoc.synth.v`
- Continue with post-synthesis simulation

### Pre-Synthesis vs. Post-Synthesis Simulation

| Characteristic      | Pre-Synthesis Simulation (RTL Simulation)                                    | Post-Synthesis Simulation (Gate-Level Simulation)                                                    |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input Design**    | High-level **RTL** (Register Transfer Level) code (Verilog/VHDL).              | **Gate-level netlist** generated by a synthesis tool.                                                |
| **Primary Goal**    | To verify the **functional correctness** of the design's logic and algorithm.  | To verify the synthesized netlist is logically equivalent to the RTL and to check for **timing violations**. |
| **Abstraction Level** | **Behavioral**: Describes *what* the circuit does.                             | **Structural**: Describes the circuit as a connection of specific logic gates from a technology library. |
| **Timing Model**    | **Idealistic**: Assumes zero or unit delays. Does not consider physical delays. | **Realistic**: Includes timing delays of logic gates and can be annotated with wire delays (from an SDF file). |
| **Simulation Speed**  | **Fast**, as it operates at a higher level of abstraction.                  | **Slow**, as it simulates every gate and its associated delay, which is computationally intensive.     |
| **When to Use**     | Early in the design flow to quickly find and fix logical bugs.                 | After synthesis to ensure the tool did not introduce errors and to perform initial timing analysis.       |

## 7. Troubleshooting Guide

### 7.1 Common Environment Issues

#### Issue: `sandpiper-saas: command not found`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify Python virtual environment is activated
source sp_env/bin/activate

# Reinstall if necessary
pip install --upgrade sandpiper-saas
```

#### Issue: `iverilog: command not found`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Icarus Verilog
sudo apt install iverilog

# Verify installation
which iverilog
iverilog -V
```

### 7.2 Compilation Issues

#### Issue: Include file not found
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check file paths
ls -la src/module/
ls -la src/include/

# Verify include directories in iverilog command
iverilog -I src/include -I src/module ...
```

#### Issue: Module not found during compilation
**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure all required modules are present
ls src/module/vsdbabysoc.v
ls src/module/rvmyth.v
ls src/module/avsdpll.v
ls src/module/avsddac.v
```

### 7.3 Simulation Issues



#### Issue: No VCD file generated
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check testbench for VCD dump commands
grep -n "\$dumpfile\|\$dumpvars" src/module/testbench.v

# Verify output directory permissions
ls -la output/pre_synth_sim/
```

### 7.4 GTKWave Issues

#### Issue: Cannot see analog waveform
**Solution:**
1. Ensure you selected `uut.dac.OUT` (type `real`)
2. Right-click → Data Format → Analog → Step
3. Verify signal is not `uut.OUT` (digital wire)

#### Issue: Waveform appears corrupted
**Solution:**
```bash
# Regenerate VCD file
cd output/pre_synth_sim
./pre_synth_sim.out

# Reload in GTKWave
# File → Reload Waveform
```

### 7.5 Post-synthesis Issues

#### Issue: ABC assertion failure
**Status:** Known issue, not user error
**Workaround:** Document issue and proceed with pre-synthesis results
**Future Resolution:** Use OpenLANE Docker environment in later weeks
